# KNOW-PLAN
ROS package to use a knowledge base to represent and reason with knowledge about plans for plan comparison and selection (disambiguation). This package allows to run the knowledge base using *rosprolog*, which includes features to be used within ROS (e.g., one can query the knowledge base calling a ROS service). 

Please, note that we are currently cleaning the code and preparing it to merge it to the main branch. Check the 'dev' branch to see the current version of *know-plan*.
